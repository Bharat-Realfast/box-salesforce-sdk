# Box Salesforce SDK

This is the Salesforce SDK for integrating with the [Box Platform](https://developer.box.com/).

## Quickstart

The SDK can be deployed directly to Sandbox or Developer orgs by clicking:

[![Deploy to Salesforce](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afawcett/githubsfdeploy/master/src/main/webapp/resources/img/deploy.png)](https://githubsfdeploy.herokuapp.com?owner=box&repo=box-salesforce-sdk)

> "Deploy to Salesforce" functionality is not owned or operated by Box.

The SDK is also distributed as an umanaged package.

- [Production/Developer Package Link](https://cloud.box.com/Box-Apex-SDK)
- [Sandbox Package Link](https://cloud.box.com/Box-Apex-SDK-Sandbox)

> Unmanaged packages can't be upgraded once installed in a Salesforce org so future upgrades will have to be applied by cloning the repo locally and updating classes from your IDE.
